# PaperPlaneTetra -- (Heavily) Customized Plurk CSS

A Material Design like theme for my Plurk.

Originally I used a [gist](https://gist.github.com/andy0130tw/a3825c7610efcbdbe245) to manage the CSS. It had grown too big so I could hardly maintain afterwards. I decided to port it to SCSS as a practice. **(WIP)**

(The name of the project was coined randomly. Please don't ask me why.)
